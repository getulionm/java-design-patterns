Adapter pattern is a greta pattern for connecting new code to legacy code without
 having to change the working contract what was produced from the legacy code originally

Concepts:
. Plug adaptor
. Converting interface into another interface
. Legacy
. Translates requests from the client to the code that we are adapting to
. Client > Adapter > Adaptee
Examples: Arrays -> Lists, Streams

Design:
. Client centric
. Integrate new with old
. Interface, but not required
. Adaptee can be the implementation

Pitfalls:
- Don't complicate
- Multiple Adapters
- Don't add functionality

Contrast:

        | ADAPTER |                              | BRIDGE |
- Works after code is designed              - Designed upfront
- Legacy                                    - Abstraction and implementation vary
- Retrofitted                               - Built in advance
- Provides different interface              - Both adapt multiple systems

Summary:
- Simple solution
- Easy to implement
- Integrate with Legacy
- Can provide multiple Adapters
